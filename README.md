# IAMM SDK

This project was generated with [Trampoline](https://github.com/Tempest-Protocol/trampoline).


## Organization

### Generators
High level functions that use a `TContract` to perform operations (by generating transactions) that interact with IAMM NFTs. 

### Schemas
Molecule-defined structures and bindings to rust-native types.

### Scripts
Smart contracts written with [Capsule](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/capsule)


**Note**: Currently, the Capsule smart contract does not successfully build. This is due to a dependence on a previous version of Trampoline that provided `no_std` compatibility for schemas. A fix is underway and will be available soon.
